Properties
provides flexible mechanism to do the following to private fields: 
* Read
* Write
* Compute its value

Think of them as accessors providing access to data with safety and flexibility.

Code we put into the getter and setters depends on:
* what the property is
* how it will be used
- protection it requires

getter = lazy loading
setter = validate incoming value

When no additional logic is need in a property, you should consider using Auto Implemented Properties.
There are two things that to keep in mind when creating Auto-Implemented Properties?
