Static Classes

DO
You want to use static classes sparingly, and the main reason why is because they're meant for supporting classes. 
They don't really work well with OOP features.
They don't implement an interface.
They can't have parameterized constructors, and they can't be inherited from.
So, they're good for something like common utilities.
DON'T
Use as a random bucket
