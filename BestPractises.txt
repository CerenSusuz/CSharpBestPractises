C# Best Practises
Standards and conventions serve the following purposes. 
They create a consistent look to the code so that 
readers can focus on the content and not the layout. 
They also enable readers to understand the code more quickly 
by making assumptions based on previous experience, 
and they facilitate copying, changing, and maintaining the code.

When to use them: Most of the time!
